Rust is a modern programming language known for its focus on safety, performance, and concurrency. Developed by Mozilla, it offers memory safety without sacrificing performance, making it suitable for systems programming. Rust's strong type system and ownership model prevent common bugs like null pointer dereferencing and data races, leading to more reliable code. Its syntax is influenced by C and ML languages, providing a familiar yet powerful environment for developers. With a thriving community and extensive documentation, Rust is gaining popularity for projects ranging from operating systems to web servers, demonstrating its versatility and robustness in modern software development.
